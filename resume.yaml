  summary: I am a very enthusiastic and dedicated problem solver with a passion for science, technology, and learning.
    After attacking a problem, successful or not, I love teaching others about it.
    I enjoy working in a team to dig through and understand complex systems, whether social networks, natural language, or nuclear physics.
